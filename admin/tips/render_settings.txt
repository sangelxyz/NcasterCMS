PHP scripting is disabled by default, to enable it first enable entity then open view.php in your editor and change the $phpscripting variables value to yes. 
While Caching will increase load time dramatically, however your pages will be static so any dynamic parts of your site will not update until the cache expires.
In ncaster 1.7 you can now change your tags prefix this allows you to use the classic &lt;!--tagname--&gt;, 1.7 standard &lt;!$tag$&gt; or your own.
Entity is a native template scripting language that you can use in your templates to give them a dynamic edge with the language you can apply functions to strings to manipulate objects or text on your page.
Gzip content encoding increases load time for the end user however it does take a fair amount of cpu time to compress the page the recommended compression level is 3.
If you enable caching make sure you set a decent expire time, the expire time is when you want the page to refresh, for sites that don't often update you may decide to only update every 1440m (24hors)
