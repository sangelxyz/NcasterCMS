    Ncaster 1.7.</font></font><br>
    <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project ncaster 
    1.7 is brute combination of speed, flexability and ease of use it features:<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Modular 
    template engine:<br>
    The new Morlock template engine is a fully modular template engine it allows 
    you to print and modifi variables on the fly and it also provides content 
    encoding and caching (template and full page rendering).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scritable 
    templates: Entity 2.<br>
    A big part of the new template engine is ncaster 1.7's native template scripting 
    language (Entity 2), To put it basicly entity allows you to modifi varables 
    on the fly it features a module based engine with a whole host of included 
    functions such as substring, lowercase, uppercase, colorswitch, ex_counter, 
    articlelist, field exsists &amp; field not exsists more modules will be avaliable 
    for download in just a short time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    Two of the most powerfull entity functions is article list and colorswitch</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Article 
    List<br>
    Is a dynamic version of ncasters build list function optimised to run with 
    minimal query ussage, it allows you to create formated lists of articles such 
    as headlines, additinal news pages ect and place them any where in your template(s).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Color 
    switch<br>
    While basic at hart it shows how easy yet powerfull entity 2 modules can be 
    this color switch just switchs inbetween to colors which enables you to create 
    multi-colored news items or used with modules for example you could have multi-colored 
    tables.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a 
    few other nice feature of entity 2 is the ability to modifi a verable with 
    multiple functions example.<br>
    {$var|setvar|&quot;Hey world&quot;}<br>
    {$var|lower|&quot;&quot;}<br>
    {* Current out put whould be hey world *}<br>
    {$var|substr|&quot;3&quot;}</font><br>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">{* now it's just 
    hey*}</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
    entity function can also have an ulimited amount of arguments &amp; entity 
    is persistent that means you can incremate numbers or store things in memorey 
    to come back to later in anouther call examples of this is ex_counter which 
    incremates for every time it's called which is great for adding numbers to 
    tables.</font></p>
