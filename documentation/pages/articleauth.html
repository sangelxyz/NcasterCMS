    <strong>Article Authentication</strong><br>
    Over View: As of ncaster 1.7.2, ncaster now supports article authentication 
    this allows you to edit, delete, move news items before they are published 
    to be viewed by your readers.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only 
    two groups can currently edit non-published news items and they are admin 
    and the new editor group, the editor group is almost the same as the admin 
    with out the ability to change any settings, but he can edit any article. 
    To enable the article authentication system go to settings &gt; display settings 
    and enable it.</font></p>
