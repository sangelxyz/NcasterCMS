// ncaster 1.7.1 (1.7 build 2)
* September 19, it's time to start finishing ncaster 1.7 project up, release day is tomorrow night (Saterday)
and there is still about 7 known bugs and about 5 small features and the upgrade script for ncaster 1.7b2 i have to fix before release, i have also added
a the new universal link system where you can link to more then one article with the same id, you change
the article by simply changing the category name example . ?rid=7&c=news and ?rid=7&c=reviews, if there is more then one
it simple selects the first one found, i also scraped the require idear today and used made it a block system, it's compatable with
phpnukes hopfully some people will port there works over. ^-^
* today 17 auguest i started on ComCaster 2, which is ncasters comments module,
i decided to make it more message board like then simply making it like a normal comments addon.
* started to update the search module to make it compatable with the new relation system.
* finaly added filtering for the news module.
* fixed a bug in filtering, it should be more frendly to forms now.
* updated the filtering today so it whould work with hub binding and related articles.
* i finished the basic xml out put script, it's very basic.
* redone the layout for the defalt install, looks much clener now and is much smaller. it should reduce 
the size of the download by a nice margin.
* finished a small relational addon for entity to take advantage of the new hubs feature, this new addon allows you to
display related articles, more addons like this will come soon.
* i have finished a new template naming system that allows you to change any template in a module,
easily from the admin, this system is a 4 tie system it checks for a layout for each category, each module and each category in a module
can be give a template each. modules can also have there own templates.
* i have just added a new major feature called Hubs, these allow you to relate data, they
are no liner and it is an extreamly easy way to maintain large sites.
* After the buggy release of the public beta i started going though the code in search of
bugs, i found quite a few and im quite pleased with the current version.

// Ncaster 1.7 (First 1.7 Build)
* Php is now allowed in templates, it's however disabled by defalt.
* I have updated the entity 2 rootines, you can now use objects and functions and modifi variables more then once though out a template.
* today i have added even more modules to entity rand, randstr, upper and lower
* i have coded up some modules for entity 2, article list & color switch thats now a total of 5 plugins.
* Added a new category system, it will be more compatable now with my future plans plus it has some nice new features
such as a category avatar and template selectection while editing or adding a category, it also solves the assiging problem.
* added the feature to bump articles.
* fixed a small bug when editing custom fields, every time a field was edited it both added
and updated the database where it should only do one, this has been fixed which should also fix
all abnormalties when using custom fields.
* New MorLock display engine, it now catchs pages display times are as low 0.004 before 0.02 
this is only the first engine i plan on making it more flexable and allow dynamic functions to load.
* added the ability to delete more then one template at a time.
* done a fair bit of table fixes the could have resolted in display errors and confusion.
* added resize function in the upload box, this enables resizing of images, you can select the width and height or select a pre-set size from a drop down.
* Template editing has been updateded hopfully it's right this time, 
you can use java script in your templates as well as &amp; tags ncaster now can determin the diffrence even with the restrictions
of the text box.
* Added clean up function to view.php, cleans un used tags.
* tags format has changed it's now <!$tagname$> for main tags
* View.php has been updated again, not a speed increase this time but now the urls are much shorter for articles. view.php?id=id this now no longer needs c= in the url
quary in order to work. old way was view.php?load=arcview&article=id&c=categoryname.
* Nav'E code has been updated it now features unique quary building code, this allows you to use as many nav tags as you want
and it will still just use 1 quary no matter what, old system used one quary per nav tag.
* formating system has been updated, it's now slightly faster but the real advantage is that you can now use [nav][/nav] in conjunction with entity for some truly
dynamic dual layered content creation.
* display tags <!--url--> <!--dynamic_url--> ect have been updated, in some browsers or xml generated pages the & can cuase an error
this has been fixed, amoung those changers the template editing, news editing and saving has also been updated to hopfully fix the same problems above.
* Made it so you do not need c=category anymore in linking to articles however you will still need it for most other modules.
* started a xml feed script based on the view.php, it's very fast and features gzip compression.
* Added  Backup script with Zip, Gzip and Bzip compression.
* Addon Mangerment has been upgraded, you can now use [load=addonfoldername] to load any addons, note all addons will need to be updated
to the latest versions.
* Require function has been added to view.php this allows you to require in php pages in view.php!
* genfields function has been moved in to it's own file, it was takin up to much code space and it was loaded when it was not
needed this will hopfully increase the admin speed by as much as 10-20%.
* Added SubStr function to Entity code this allows you to cut down the value of a field in bytes
eg. field value= hello world, you could strip it down to two bytes or so to equal field value= he.
* I wrote a Gconnection Class this enables remote connections to servers to download files. 
* i have implemented a Wysiwyg Editor that ive been working on slowly for the last few weeks, it's not feature packed
but it is very light weight (3.1kb) and does offer you some nice html features.
* Nice shiny new admin skin, Like it ? i have also implemented a information box that will give you helpfull hints thoughtout ncaster admin.

// Ncaster 1.6.5

before being saved, this has been fixed
* install.php has been fixed since some where having trouble with progressing though it, this was actualy due to extensive
changers to the new php revision 4.3.0 this unfortunity disabled ncaster as well, it was a big fix but ncaster now works
with the latest revision of php.
* i have added 2 more field types to ncaster genre selection and system selection both aimed at game sites.
