# NcasterCMS
Content Management System NcasterCMS, Developed in 2002-2004. It was originaly a port of my Perl based content management system Nforce (NewsForce)

NcasterCMS has not been maintained in nearly 18years, this is just an example of my past work. 

NCasterCMS was one of the first Content Management Systems for PHP, using MYSQL as the database engine. It's unique feature was custom fields, plugin's, templete & Scripting engines it also run very fast. It was popular for gaming and entertainment websites at this time.

I made plugin modifications to run a popular image hosting site largeimagehost.com which was later sold.
