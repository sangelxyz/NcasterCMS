# NcasterCMS
Content Management System NcasterCMS, Developed in 2002-2004.

NcasterCMS has not been maintained in nearly 18years, this is just an example of my past work. 

NCasterCMS was one of the first Content Management Systems for PHP, It used MYSQL as the database. It's unique feature was custom fields and it's own scripting and plugin engine. It was popular for gaming and entertainment websites at this time.
